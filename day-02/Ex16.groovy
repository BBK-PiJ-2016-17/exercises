/**
 * Exercise 16 - Rock, Paper, Scissors (*)
 *
 * Write a program that reads 2 characters from either the keyboard or a file.
 * The characters are either PP, PR, PS, RP, RR, RS, SP, SR, or SS.
 * They correspond to the selections made by 2 players playing the game of
 * rock-paper-scissors.
 *
 * Make the program accept inputs until one playerâ€™s score is more than 3 points
 * ahead of the other.
 *
 * Hint: remember that you can use .substring() to get the elements of a String.
