 * 2.3 c) Hanoi towers
 *
 * A legend says that, somewhere in the East, near Hanoi, there is a temple.
 * In the temple, there are three posts. In the posts, there are 64 discs of 64
 * different sizes. When the world was created, all the discs were in the first
 * post; when all the discs are moved to the last post, the world will end.
 * The monks in the temple move the discs between posts, but they must obey two
 * simple rules. First, only one disc can be moved at a time, from one post to
 * another post (it cannot be left anywhere else). Last, but not least, a disc
 * can only be placed on top of a bigger disc, never on top of a smaller disc.
 * The smallest disc can be placed on any post (all other discs are bigger);
 * the biggest disc can only be placed on an empty post.
 * Create a method that calculates the number of moves necessary to move a set
 * of n Hanoi disks from the initial post to the last post. Hint: if you want to
 * play monk yourself in order to better understand the problem, ask the
 * lecturer for a “Hanoi envelope”.
